# Components

This directory contains all React components for the wedding management platform.

## Structure

- `ui/` - Base UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, modals, etc.)
- `master/` - Master admin-specific components
- `planner/` - Wedding planner dashboard components
- `admin/` - Wedding admin panel components
- `guest/` - Guest-facing RSVP components

## Conventions

- All components are TypeScript with proper prop types
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (mobile-first)
- Components should be atomic and reusable where possible
- Integrate with i18n for all user-facing text

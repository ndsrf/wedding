# Type Definitions

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.

## Structure

- `models.ts` - Database model types (matching Prisma schema)
- `api.ts` - API request/response types
- `theme.ts` - Theme configuration types

## Conventions

- Keep types aligned with Prisma schema
- Use TypeScript utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit) where appropriate
- Export all types for use across the application
- Document complex types with comments

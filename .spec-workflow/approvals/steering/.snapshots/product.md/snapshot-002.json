It solves the critical problem of managing RSVPs, tracking gifts, and coordinating with guest families across multiple weddings simultaneously, while eliminating authentication barriers for guests through persistent magic links.\n\n**Core Problem Solved**: Traditional wedding RSVP management is fragmented across email, WhatsApp, phone calls, and spreadsheets. Guests struggle with complex login systems, planners lose track of responses, and couples spend countless hours manually tracking who's coming and matching bank transfers to families.\n\n**Our Solution**: A unified platform where planners manage multiple weddings, couples access their specific wedding data, and guests RSVP instantly via magic links without creating accounts—all optimized for mobile and WhatsApp in-app browsers.\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users\n\n1. **Wedding Planners (Paying Customers)**\n   -

Magic links eliminate passwords. Forms are mobile-first with large touch targets. Language switching is obvious and persistent. The RSVP flow should take <2 minutes on a phone.\n\n**Why**: Spanish families include elderly relatives uncomfortable with technology. WhatsApp is the primary communication channel. Any friction = lower RSVP completion = more manual work for couples.\n\n**Example**: A 70-year-old grandmother clicks a WhatsApp link, sees her family name, checks who's coming, submits—done. No account, no password, no email verification.\n\n### 2. **Data Isolation by Default**\n\nMulti-tenancy is non-negotiable. Every database query must filter by `wedding_id`. Wedding admins see only their wedding. Planners see only their weddings. No cross-contamination ever.\n\n**Why**: Trust is paramount. One data leak destroys reputation. GDPR compliance requires clear data boundaries. Planners need confidence their clients' data is protected.\n\n**Example**: Prisma middleware automatically injects `wedding_id` filters. API routes validate access before any operation. Row-level security as additional layer.\n\n### 3. **Mobile-First, Always**\n\nDesktop is a luxury. Mobile is reality. Design for WhatsApp in-app browser first, then expand to other contexts.\n\n**Why**: Spanish users are mobile-dominant. Couples manage weddings on-the-go. Guests respond from their phones. Any desktop-only feature is unusable.\n\n**Example**: All touch targets ≥44px. Forms use native mobile inputs. Navigation fits within thumb reach. No hover-only interactions.\n\n### 4. **Progressive Disclosure**\n\nDon't overwhelm users with every feature upfront. Start simple, reveal complexity only when needed.\n\n**Why**: Wedding planning is already overwhelming. Too many options paralyze decision-making. Advanced users will find advanced features—don't force them on everyone.\n\n**Example**: Wedding creation starts with basics (names, date, location). Payment mode can be toggled later. Theme selection is optional (default provided). Guest additions can be disabled if not needed.\n\n### 5. **Cultural Context Matters**\n\nSpanish weddings are family-centric, multi-generational events. Bank transfers (not credit cards) are the standard gift method. WhatsApp is how families communicate.\n\n**Why**: A product designed for US weddings fails in Spain. Cultural assumptions around gifts, communication channels, and family structures differ.\n\n**Example**: RSVP is family-based (not individual). Payment tracking uses IBAN + reference codes. WhatsApp is the primary invitation channel. Multi-language support is essential for international friends.\n\n### 6. **Planner Success = Product Success**\n\nThe product exists to make planners successful and profitable. If planners succeed, they stay subscribed. If couples are happy, planners get referrals.\n\n**Why**: Planners are the paying customers. Their business model depends on efficiency and client satisfaction. Our platform must multiply their capacity.\n\n**Example**: Planner dashboard shows high-level stats across all weddings at a glance. Theme gallery lets them white-label experiences. Minimal training required to onboard couples.\n\n### 7. **Observability Without Surveillance**\n\nTrack what matters for functionality (RSVP status, payment confirmation) but respect privacy. Don't track for tracking's sake.\n\n**Why**: GDPR compliance. User trust. Ethical product development. Only collect data that serves a clear purpose.\n\n**Example**: Track \"link opened via WhatsApp\" for attribution. Track \"RSVP submitted\" for notifications. Don't track browsing patterns, time on page, or personal device details.\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n### Dashboard Types\n\n1. **Master Admin Dashboard** (Web-based)\n   - List of all wedding planners with status (Active/Disabled)\n   -

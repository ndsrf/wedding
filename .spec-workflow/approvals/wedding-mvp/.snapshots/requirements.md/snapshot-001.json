The platform provides family-centric RSVP management, payment tracking, and guest communication through magic links. This MVP focuses on core functionality: platform administration, wedding planner features, wedding admin capabilities, and the guest RSVP experience.\n\n**Target Users:**\n- **Master Admin**: Platform owner managing wedding planners\n- **Wedding Planners**: Paying customers who manage multiple weddings (Spanish market)\n- **Wedding Admins**: Couples granted free access by planners to manage their wedding\n- **Guest Families**: Spanish families attending weddings (no login required)\n\n**Business Model**: Wedding planners subscribe monthly and grant free access to couples. Guests access via persistent magic links.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis MVP establishes the foundation for a wedding management platform that:\n- Eliminates authentication friction for guests (magic links instead of passwords)\n- Supports multi-tenancy with clear data isolation\n- Enables wedding planners to scale their business across multiple clients\n- Provides a mobile-first, elderly-friendly experience optimized for WhatsApp in-app browsers\n- Supports international families with 5 languages (Spanish, English, French, Italian, German)\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Master Admin Platform Management\n\n**User Story:** As a master admin, I want to manage wedding planner accounts from a central dashboard, so that I can control who has access to the platform.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the master admin signs in with OAuth (Google) THEN the system SHALL verify their email matches the config file and grant access\n2. WHEN the master admin views the planner list THEN the system SHALL display all planners with status (Active/Disabled), wedding count, and last login timestamp\n3. WHEN the master admin adds a new planner THEN the system SHALL require name, logo, and contact email\n4. WHEN the master admin toggles a planner's enabled status THEN the system SHALL immediately update access for that planner\n5. IF a planner is disabled THEN they SHALL NOT be able to access the platform or create new weddings\n6. WHEN the master admin views weddings THEN the system SHALL display all weddings across all planners in read-only mode\n\n### Requirement 2: Wedding Planner Multi-Wedding Management\n\n**User Story:** As a wedding planner, I want to create and manage multiple weddings for different clients, so that I can serve multiple couples simultaneously.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a planner signs in with OAuth (Google, Facebook/Instagram, or Apple) THEN the system SHALL authenticate and remember their last login provider\n2. WHEN a planner first logs in THEN the system SHALL prompt them to choose their preferred language (es/en/fr/it/de)\n3. WHEN a planner views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all weddings with date, guest count, RSVP completion %, and status\n4. WHEN a planner creates a new wedding THEN the system SHALL require couple names, wedding date/time, location, RSVP cutoff date, and default language\n5. WHEN a planner creates a wedding THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of payment tracking mode (automated/manual) and guest addition permissions\n6. WHEN a planner selects a wedding THEN the system SHALL scope all subsequent actions to that wedding only\n7. WHEN a planner invites a wedding admin THEN the system SHALL send an email with OAuth sign-in link granting access to that specific wedding only\n8. IF a planner is disabled by master admin THEN all their wedding admins SHALL lose access immediately\n\n### Requirement 3: Wedding Admin Guest Management\n\n**User Story:** As a wedding admin (couple), I want to import my guest list and manage RSVPs, so that I can track who is attending without manual data entry.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a wedding admin signs in with OAuth THEN the system SHALL verify they have access to the invited wedding only\n2. WHEN a wedding admin first logs in THEN the system SHALL remember which OAuth provider they used for future logins\n3. WHEN a wedding admin uploads an Excel file THEN the system SHALL validate required columns (Family Name, Contact Person, Member names/types) and import families\n4. IF the Excel includes a Language column THEN the system SHALL assign that language preference to each family (default to wedding's default language)\n5. WHEN importing families THEN the system SHALL generate unique magic tokens and reference codes (if automated payment mode)\n6. WHEN a wedding admin views the guest dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all families with RSVP status, attendance, payment status, and channel used\n7. WHEN a wedding admin filters guests THEN the system SHALL support filtering by RSVP status, attendance, channel, and payment status\n8. WHEN a wedding admin exports guest data THEN the system SHALL generate an Excel file with all current data including RSVP and payment status\n9. WHEN a wedding admin adds additional admins THEN the system SHALL send invitation emails and grant them access to this wedding only\n10. WHEN a wedding admin sets an RSVP cutoff date THEN the system SHALL enforce read-only access for guests after that date\n\n### Requirement 4: Magic Link Guest Authentication\n\n**User Story:** As a guest family, I want to access my RSVP page without creating an account, so that I can respond quickly without authentication barriers.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.

WHEN a family clicks their magic link THEN the system SHALL log the event with channel attribution and grant immediate access\n4. WHEN a family accesses their RSVP page THEN the system SHALL display content in their preferred language (from database or URL parameter)\n5. WHEN a family changes language via dropdown THEN the system SHALL persist the choice for future visits\n6. IF a family loses their link THEN the system SHALL allow wedding admin to resend the same persistent token\n7. WHEN a family returns via the same magic link THEN the system SHALL maintain their session without re-authentication\n\n### Requirement 5: Family-Based RSVP Submission\n\n**User Story:** As a guest family, I want to select which family members will attend from a pre-populated list, so that I can accurately confirm attendance for my entire family unit.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.

WHEN a family submits their RSVP THEN the system SHALL save selections and display a clear confirmation message\n7. WHEN a family submits their RSVP THEN the system SHALL create a tracking event with event_type='rsvp_submitted' and channel attribution\n8. IF the current date is before the RSVP cutoff THEN the system SHALL allow the family to edit their RSVP\n9. IF the current date is after the RSVP cutoff THEN the system SHALL display read-only RSVP details with a message to contact the couple directly\n\n### Requirement 6: Payment Information Display\n\n**User Story:** As a guest family, I want to see bank transfer details after submitting my RSVP, so that I can send a gift with proper reference information.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.
